LSD: Dream Emulator


LBD format

A LBD file contains part of a stage in LSD.
The stages are made up of 'tiles', placed according to the lay-out data.
The tiles can also reference 'extra tiles', to be placed at the same spot.
Each tile's model is saved in the 'tiles'-TMD file
The file also contains a MML file, for the entities in that part of the stage.

Structure:
Ushort - identifier(?, always 1)
Ushort - 1 if the file contains a MML, 0 otherwise.
Uint - offset for certain addresses(?, always 24)
Uint - offset to 'tiles'-TMD file, minus 24 (adr. offset?)
  (from start of LBD file)
Uint - length of 'tiles'-TMD file
Uint - offset to MML file (from start of LBD file,
  points outside of file if it doesn't have a MML file)
Uint - size of MML file (0 if the file doesn't have a MML file)
Ushort - ?, always 74
Ushort - amount of 'extra tiles' ($a)
Ushort - width(?, always 20)
Ushort - height(?, always 20)
LBDtile[400] - The tile layout for this stage-part
  (20 by 20, ordered left to right, bottom to top)
LBDtile[$a] - 'extra tiles', referenced from the tile layout data
TMD - the 'tiles'-TMD
byte[?] - filler bytes (all 00)
MML[0-1] - the entities-data


LBD tile format

Structure:
byte - 1 if the tile needs to be placed, 0 otherwise
byte - ?, always 0 or 1
Ushort - tile number, a index into the tile-TMD
byte - collision and footstep sound:
  below 0x80: no collision
  above 0x80: collision (with walls, floor collision is automatic)
byte - rotation, 0-3 for 0, 90, 180, 270 degrees rotated
short - (signed) height, 0 is default,
  lower (-1, -2...) is higher, higher (1, 2...) is lower.
Uint - offset to 'extra tile', minus 24 (adr. offset?),
  0 if no extra tile is needed


MML format

A MML file contains all the entities in a stage-part.

Structure:
byte[4] - identifier: "MML " (4D 4D 4C 20)
Uint - amount of MOM files ($b)
Uint[$b] - offsets to the MOM files (from start of MML file)
MOM[$b] - the MOM files
