TIX format

A TIX file contains a bunch of TIM textures,
which are all loaded in VRAM at once.
The file consists of a bunch of TIX chunks, each with TIM textures inside.

Structure:
Uint - amount of TIX-chunks ($a)
Uint[$a] - offsets to the TIX-chunks (from start of TIX file)
Uint[$a] - sizes of the TIX-chunks
byte[?] - filler bytes (all 00)
TIXchunk[$a] - The TIX-chunks


TIX chunk format

Structure:
Uint - amount of TIM files ($b)
Uint[$b] - offsets to the TIM files (from start of TIX chunk)
TIM[$b] - the TIM textures
byte[?] - filler bytes (00)
