LSD: Dream Emulator


File types

The data for the game uses the following official PS1 formats:
.TMD - 3d-model format.
.TIM - texture format.
.STR - streaming data (movies).
  Seems to repeatedly contain 7 chunks, followed by 1 chunk of audio(?) data.
.VB - Waveform audio samples body.
.VH - Waveform audio samples header.
.SEQ - music sequence format.
.TOD - animation data (only seen as part of a MOS file).

It also uses the following custom formats:
.MOS - contains TOD-animations for a model (only seen a part of a MOM file).
.MOM - contains a TMD model, together with a MOS-animation set.
.TIX - contains multiple TIM-textures, to be all loaded into VRAM at once.
.MML - contains entity data, with 1 MOM file for each
  (only seen as part of a LBD file).
.LBD - contains a section of a level:
  the TMD-models for it,
  the layout data,
  the entities in a (optional) MML file.

FILM contains 30 files, all movies:
6 STR-movies, named EVENT1.STR to EVENT6.STR, used for special in-game events.
24 STR-movies, used for video-dreams.

IMG1 and IMG2, containing 24 files each, all TIM textures.
Used for text-dreams.

SND contains 16 files, 8 VB & VH pairs.
Each is a sample-bank, randomly combined with the 5 tracks for a stage.

ZDUMMY contains 1 file, a garbage movie file ZDUMMY.STR
Used for getting the game closer to the center of the disk, for faster loading.

STG00 to STG13 are used for the stage data:
STG00: Bright moon cottage - Wh
STG01: Pit and temple - W3
STG02: Kyoto - W6
STG03: The natural world - W16
STG04: Happy town - W6
STG05: The violence district - W5
STG06: Moonlight tower - Wh
STG07: Temple dojo - W5
STG08: Flesh tunnels - W1
STG09: Clockwork tunnels - W1
STG10: Long hallway - W3
STG11: Sun faces heave - W4
STG12: Black space - W4
STG13: Monument park - W2

Wx indicates how the stage's LBD files are laid out:
  Wh means that they are all placed on the same spot, used in vertical stages.
  Wx, with x a number, means that so many are placed side by side.
  They are placed left to right, bottom to top, with each second row from
  the bottom offset to the left by half the size of a LBD-file's content

Each stage folder contains:
5 SEQ-music sequences, named BGA.SEQ to BGE.SEQ,
  randomly combined with a sample bank in SND, to form the music of the stage.
4 TIX-texture sets, named TEXA.TIX to TEXD.tix:
  TEXA are the normal textures,
  TEXB are the kanji textures,
  TEXC are the downer textures,
  TEXD are the sexual textures.
Some amount of LBD-files, named M000.LBD, M001.LBD...,
  sometimes sorted over subfolders called N1, N2....
  These contain the lay-out data, models and entity data for each stage.
